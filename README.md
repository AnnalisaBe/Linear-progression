# Linear-progression

This repository contains the R script to analyze the progression of a signal along a linear path over time.
Starting data are obtained by image analysis in Fiji, using the straight line tool to measure the distance from the starting site reached by te signal at successive time points. Information on the distance and on the time of each measure can be saved in a table and used for the analysis in R following the script provided here.
